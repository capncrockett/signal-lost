## ‚úÖ Development Rules

- C# is used for game logic and UI components
- Tests must cover ‚â• 80% of code
- Follow the [C# coding conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility (Windows and Mac)

## üéÆ Gameplay Instructions

### Main Controls

- **Radio Tuning**: Use the mouse or keyboard to tune the radio frequency
  - **Tune Up**: Press `D` or right arrow key
  - **Tune Down**: Press `A` or left arrow key
  - **Toggle Power**: Press `Space` or click the power button
  - **Scan**: Press `S` or click the scan button to find signals
  - **Messages**: Click the message button when lit to view messages
  - **Manual Tuning**: Click and drag the tuning dial for precise control
- **Interact**: Press `E` to interact with objects
- **Movement**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` or arrow keys to move in the field
- **Inventory**: Press `I` to open/close the inventory

### Game Mechanics

#### Radio Interface

The game features a pixel-based radio interface with the following components:

- **Tuning Dial**: Rotate to change frequency (88.0 MHz to 108.0 MHz)
- **Frequency Display**: Shows the current frequency in real-time
- **Signal Strength Meter**: Indicates how strong the current signal is
- **Power Button**: Turns the radio on/off
- **Scan Button**: Automatically finds the next available signal
- **Message Button**: Lights up when a message is available at the current frequency

#### Radio Signals

The game revolves around discovering and interpreting radio signals. Different frequencies contain different types of signals:

- **Location Signals**: Reveal coordinates on the map
- **Message Signals**: Provide story elements and clues
- **Item Signals**: Allow you to discover special items

Tune the radio carefully to find the clearest signal. The signal strength meter shows how close you are to a valid frequency. Audio feedback (static, tones) helps you identify signal types and strength.

#### Field Exploration

Explore the field to discover locations mentioned in radio signals. You'll find:

- **Radio Towers**: Communication hubs with valuable information
- **Ruins**: Abandoned research facilities with clues about what happened
- **Bunkers**: Secure locations with supplies and equipment

#### Inventory System

Collect and use items to progress through the game:

- **Tools**: Items like the radio and map that help you navigate
- **Documents**: Notes and journals that provide story context
- **Keys**: Used to unlock doors and access new areas
- **Radio Parts**: Enhance your radio's capabilities
- **Consumables**: One-time use items like batteries and medkits

### Story Progression

The game's narrative unfolds as you discover signals and explore locations. Pay attention to:

- The sequence of frequencies mentioned in various locations
- The mysterious "Signal Protocol" referenced in documents
- The events that led to the current state of the world

## üîÑ CI/CD Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/agent-workflow.yml` and includes:

- Linting with ESLint
- TypeScript compiler checks
- Unit and integration tests with Jest
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Building the project
- Uploading test reports and screenshots as artifacts

The workflow runs automatically on pushes to `main` and `develop` branches, as well as on pull requests to these branches. You can also trigger it manually from the GitHub Actions tab.

- Console logs must be accessible and validated in browser-based tests
- All prompts/tasks live in docs/ files and serve as acceptance criteria
- If Agent fails, it must re-read the relevant README task before retrying

## üß† Augment Agent Instructions

- You are operating on the "Signal Lost" codebase.
- Do not hallucinate functionality not in the prompt.
- Refer to the matching docs/ prompt file section before starting.
- Once you've completed a feature and verified tests + coverage pass, mark the task as ‚úÖ complete in the README and commit your changes.
- If you crash or lose state, re-read the prompt and resume from the last ‚ùå section.

- docs/agent-roles.md
