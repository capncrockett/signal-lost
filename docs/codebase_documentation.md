## Architecture Overview

Signal Lost is built using the Godot Engine (version 4.x) with C# as the scripting language. The game follows a component-based architecture with the following key design principles:

### Singleton Pattern

Core game systems are implemented as singletons (autoloaded nodes) to provide global access to their functionality. These include:

- `GameState`: Manages the overall game state
- `AudioManager`: Handles all audio playback
- `QuestSystem`: Manages quests and objectives
- `InventorySystem`: Handles inventory and items
- `MapSystem`: Manages locations and navigation
- `GameProgressionManager`: Controls game progression
- `SaveManager`: Handles saving and loading game data
- `MessageManager`: Manages in-game messages

### Scene-Based Components

Game UI and interactive elements are implemented as scenes that can be instantiated and added to the scene tree. These include:

- `RadioTuner`: The interactive radio interface
- `InventoryUI`: The inventory display and interaction
- `MapInterface`: The map display and navigation
- `MessageDisplay`: Displays decoded messages
- `PixelMapInterface`: Pixel-based map visualization

### Signal-Based Communication

Components communicate using Godot's built-in signal system, which provides a decoupled way for objects to interact. For example:

- `GameState` emits signals when the radio is toggled or frequency changes
- `QuestSystem` emits signals when quests are discovered or completed
- `InventorySystem` emits signals when items are added or used

## Core Systems

### GameState

The `GameState` class is the central repository for game state information. It manages:

- Radio state (on/off, frequency, discovered frequencies)
- Player state (health, hunger, thirst)

- Messages and signals
- Current location

Key methods:
- `SetFrequency(float frequency)`: Sets the radio frequency
- `ToggleRadio()`: Toggles the radio on/off
- `FindSignalAtFrequency(float frequency)`: Finds a signal at the given frequency
- `DecodeMessage(string messageId)`: Decodes a message
- `SetCurrentLocation(string locationId)`: Sets the current location

### QuestSystem

The `QuestSystem` class manages quests and objectives. It handles:

- Quest discovery and activation

## Game Mechanics

### Radio Mechanics

The radio is a central gameplay mechanic. It allows the player to:

- Tune to different frequencies
- Detect signals
- Decode messages
- Discover new locations

The `RadioTuner` class implements the interactive radio interface, while the `GameState` class manages the underlying radio state.

### Survival Mechanics

The game includes survival mechanics such as:

- Health: Decreases when the player takes damage
- Hunger: Decreases over time, affects health when very low
- Thirst: Decreases over time, affects health when very low
- Day/night cycle: Affects survival stat depletion rates

These mechanics are managed by the `GameState` class and are updated in the `_Process` method.

### Exploration Mechanics

Exploration is a key gameplay element. It allows the player to:

- Discover new locations
- Find items
- Complete quests
- Advance the story

The `MapSystem` class manages exploration mechanics, while the `PixelMapInterface` class provides the visual representation.

### Quest Mechanics

Quests drive the game's narrative and progression. They include:

- Main quests: Drive the main story
- Side quests: Provide additional content
- Location-based quests: Discovered by visiting locations
- Item-based quests: Require specific items

The `QuestSystem` class manages quest mechanics, while the `GameProgressionManager` class ties quests to progression.

## User Interface

### Pixel-Based UI

The game uses a pixel-based UI approach for a retro aesthetic. This includes:

- Programmatically drawn UI elements
- Pixel-perfect rendering
- Limited color palette
- Grid-based layouts

The pixel-based UI is implemented using Godot's drawing primitives and custom shaders.

## Audio System

The `AudioManager` class handles all audio playback. It includes:

### Static Noise Generation

The `AudioManager` can generate different types of noise:

- White noise: Equal energy per frequency
- Pink noise: 1/f spectrum (more natural sounding)
- Brown noise: 1/fÂ² spectrum (deeper rumble)
- Digital noise: Harsh, bit-crushed sound

These are generated procedurally using the `GenerateWhiteNoise()`, `GeneratePinkNoise()`, `GenerateBrownNoise()`, and `GenerateDigitalNoise()` methods.

### Signal Tone Generation

The `AudioManager` can generate different waveforms for signal tones:

- Sine wave: Smooth, pure tone
- Square wave: Harsh, buzzy tone
- Triangle wave: Softer than square, but still distinct
- Sawtooth wave: Sharp, bright tone

These are generated procedurally in the `FillSignalBuffer()` method.

### Audio Effects

The `AudioManager` applies various audio effects to create a realistic radio sound:

- EQ: Shapes the frequency response
- Distortion: Adds grit and character
- Bandpass filter: Creates a radio-like sound
- Reverb: Adds space and depth

These effects are set up in the `SetupAudioEffects()` method.

### Volume Control

The `AudioManager` provides volume control for different audio sources:

- Master volume: Controls overall volume
- Static volume: Controls static noise volume
- Signal volume: Controls signal tone volume

These are controlled using the `SetVolume()` method and Godot's audio bus system.

## Testing Framework

Signal Lost uses a custom testing framework built on top of the Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting framework. It includes:

### Base Test Classes

- `TestBase`: Base class for all tests
