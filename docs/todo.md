# Signal Lost: Pixel-Based Godot Implementation

## Overview

Signal Lost has been successfully migrated to the Godot Engine with a pixel-based UI approach. This document outlines the current state of the project, upcoming tasks, and technical considerations.

The pixel-based approach offers several advantages:

1. Better performance and resource usage
2. More authentic retro aesthetic
3. Easier to maintain and extend
4. Better cross-platform compatibility
5. More consistent visual style

## Project Goals

1. ✅ Create a fully testable game using Godot Engine
2. ✅ Maintain the core gameplay mechanics and narrative
3. ✅ Improve performance and stability
4. ✅ Establish a clean, maintainable architecture
5. ⬜ Ensure comprehensive test coverage
6. ⬜ Enable cross-platform deployment
7. ⬜ Complete the pixel-based field exploration system

## Technical Stack

- **Engine**: Godot 4.x
- **Language**: C# (Mono)
- **State Management**: Godot's built-in signals and autoloaded singletons
- **UI**: Pixel-based UI using Godot's drawing primitives
- **Testing**: C# test framework with custom test runner
- **Audio**: Godot's built-in audio system
- **Build**: Godot's export system with .NET build pipeline
