# Signal Lost: Game Development Plan

## Current Status

Signal Lost has a solid technical foundation with a pixel-based UI approach in Godot, but lacks actual gameplay content and has several issues that need to be addressed. This document outlines the plan to transform the framework into a playable game.

## Critical Issues to Fix

1. ✅ Fix radio dial control - currently "flies all over the place"
2. ✅ Implement audio system properly - missing static, beeps, and radio sounds
3. ✅ Add content to the map interface
4. ⬜ Add items to the inventory system
5. ✅ Create a clear gameplay progression system

## Game Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Fixes

1. ✅ Radio Interface Improvements

   - ✅ Fix tuning dial sensitivity and control
   - ✅ Implement proper audio feedback (static, beeps)
   - ✅ Add visual feedback for signal detection
   - ✅ Create a more intuitive frequency selection mechanism

2. ✅ Audio System Implementation

   - ✅ Fix static noise generation
   - ✅ Implement signal tones
   - ✅ Add audio effects for different signal types
   - ✅ Create ambient background sounds

3. ⬜ UI Polishing
   - ⬜ Improve visual feedback across all interfaces
   - ⬜ Ensure consistent styling
   - ⬜ Add tooltips and help text
   - ⬜ Fix any layout issues

### Phase 2: Content Creation

1. ✅ Radio Signals

   - ✅ Create a set of meaningful radio signals at different frequencies
   - ✅ Implement different signal types (Morse, voice, data)
   - ✅ Add narrative content to signals
   - ✅ Create a signal discovery system

2. ✅ Map Implementation

   - ✅ Design a game world map with key locations
   - ✅ Add points of interest that relate to radio signals
   - ✅ Implement fog of war / exploration mechanics
   - ✅ Create visual indicators for signal sources

3. ⬜ Inventory System
   - ⬜ Create a set of collectible and usable items
   - ⬜ Implement item functionality (tools, keys, documents)
   - ⬜ Add item descriptions and usage instructions
   - ⬜ Create an item discovery system

### Phase 3: Gameplay Implementation

1. ✅ Field Exploration

   - ✅ Implement player movement in the field
   - ✅ Add interactable objects and environments
   - ✅ Create environmental effects on radio signals
   - ⬜ Implement day/night cycle or time progression

2. ✅ Quest System

   - ✅ Design main storyline quests
   - ✅ Create side quests and optional objectives
   - ✅ Implement quest tracking and completion
   - ✅ Add rewards and progression mechanics

3. ✅ Game Progression
   - ✅ Implement a clear game progression system
   - ✅ Create milestones and achievements
   - ⬜ Add difficulty scaling
   - ✅ Implement an ending or conclusion

### Phase 4: Polish and Testing

1. ⬜ Visual Polish

   - ⬜ Enhance all visual elements
   - ⬜ Add animations and transitions
   - ⬜ Implement visual effects for key actions
   - ⬜ Ensure consistent pixel art style

2. ⬜ Audio Polish

   - ⬜ Create a complete soundscape
   - ⬜ Add ambient sounds and effects
   - ⬜ Implement music where appropriate
   - ⬜ Fine-tune audio mixing

3. ⬜ Comprehensive Testing
   - ⬜ Develop end-to-end tests for game scenarios
   - ⬜ Test on different platforms
   - ⬜ Perform performance optimization
   - ⬜ Fix bugs and issues

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Highest Priority**: Fix radio dial control and audio system
2. **High Priority**: Add basic content (signals, map locations, items)
3. **Medium Priority**: Implement gameplay progression
4. **Lower Priority**: Visual and audio polish

## Development Approach

1. Work in small, focused iterations
2. Implement one feature at a time
3. Test thoroughly before moving to the next feature
4. Maintain cross-platform compatibility throughout
5. Keep code clean and well-documented

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for all new functionality
2. Integration tests for feature combinations
3. End-to-end tests for gameplay scenarios
4. Manual testing for user experience
5. Cross-platform testing

## Conclusion

By following this plan, we will transform Signal Lost from a technical framework into a fully playable game with engaging content and mechanics. The focus will be on creating a cohesive experience that leverages the existing technical foundation while adding meaningful gameplay elements.
