   - Regularly integrate new features into the main development branch

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**

   - Test all features on both Windows and Mac throughout development
   - Use platform-agnostic code and resources whenever possible
   - Document any platform-specific implementations

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain up-to-date documentation for all systems
   - Create user guides for complex features
   - Document code with clear comments and explanations

## Testing Strategy

1. **Automated Testing**

   - Expand unit tests for all new functionality
   - Implement integration tests for system interactions
   - Create end-to-end tests for gameplay scenarios

2. **Manual Testing**

   - Conduct regular playtesting sessions
   - Test user experience and interface usability
   - Verify cross-platform compatibility through manual testing

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor memory usage and performance metrics
   - Test on minimum specification hardware
   - Optimize for both performance and memory efficiency
