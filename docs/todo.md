# Signal Lost: Game Development Plan (Updated)

## Current Status

Signal Lost has made significant progress with the implementation of the radio interface and various system components. The game now has a functional radio system with proper audio feedback, and the foundation for gameplay mechanics is in place. This document outlines the next steps to enhance the game and add more content.

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Cross-Platform Testing**

   - Test all radio interface components on both Windows and Mac
   - Ensure consistent behavior across platforms
   - Fix any platform-specific issues

2. **Memory Leak Resolution**

   - Identify and fix memory leaks in the radio system
   - Implement proper resource cleanup for audio components
   - Add memory profiling during gameplay

3. **Game Content Development**
   - Create a cohesive storyline that ties radio signals together
   - Develop a set of meaningful radio signals with narrative content
   - Implement a progression system that guides the player through the story

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Technical Stability (Current Focus)

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - Profile the game to identify performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize rendering for pixel-based UI elements
   - Reduce memory usage and improve resource management

2. **Audio System Enhancement**

   - Implement 8-bit/16-bit sound generation for radio signals
   - Create a more diverse range of radio static and interference effects
   - Add environmental effects that influence radio reception

3. **Save/Load System Improvement**
   - Ensure all game state is properly saved and restored
   - Implement auto-save functionality
   - Add multiple save slots and save management

### Phase 2: Content Expansion

1. **Radio Signal Content**

   - Create at least 20 unique radio signals with different types (voice, Morse, data)
   - Implement a signal discovery system with player progression
   - Add signal decoding mechanics for encrypted messages

2. **World Building**

   - Develop a detailed game world with locations tied to radio signals
   - Create a map system that reveals locations as signals are discovered
   - Implement environmental storytelling through map locations

3. **Character Development**
   - Create NPCs that communicate via radio
   - Implement character progression for the player
   - Add character-specific quests and storylines

### Phase 3: Gameplay Depth

1. **Field Exploration System**

   - Implement a field exploration mode for visiting signal locations
   - Add environmental hazards and challenges
   - Create a day/night cycle that affects signal reception

2. **Equipment System**

   - Develop upgradable radio equipment
   - Add tools for signal analysis and decoding
   - Implement equipment crafting or modification

3. **Quest System**
   - Create a comprehensive quest system with main and side quests
   - Implement quest tracking and rewards
   - Add branching quest paths based on player choices

### Phase 4: Polish and Release

1. **Visual Polish**

   - Enhance all UI elements with consistent pixel art style
   - Add animations and visual effects
   - Implement weather and environmental effects

2. **Audio Polish**

   - Create a complete soundscape for different game areas
   - Implement dynamic music that responds to gameplay
   - Fine-tune audio mixing and effects

3. **Final Testing and Optimization**
   - Conduct comprehensive testing across all platforms
   - Optimize for different hardware configurations
   - Fix any remaining bugs and issues

## Implementation Approach

1. **Iterative Development**

   - Work in small, focused iterations with clear goals
   - Implement one feature at a time with thorough testing
   - Regularly integrate new features into the main development branch

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**

   - Test all features on both Windows and Mac throughout development
   - Use platform-agnostic code and resources whenever possible
   - Document any platform-specific implementations

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain up-to-date documentation for all systems
   - Create user guides for complex features
   - Document code with clear comments and explanations

## Testing Strategy

1. **Automated Testing**

   - Expand unit tests for all new functionality
   - Implement integration tests for system interactions
   - Create end-to-end tests for gameplay scenarios

2. **Manual Testing**

   - Conduct regular playtesting sessions
   - Test user experience and interface usability
   - Verify cross-platform compatibility through manual testing

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor memory usage and performance metrics
   - Test on minimum specification hardware
   - Optimize for both performance and memory efficiency

## Conclusion

With the radio interface now functional, the focus shifts to expanding game content and ensuring technical stability. By following this updated plan, Signal Lost will evolve into a rich, engaging game with a unique focus on radio communication and exploration.
