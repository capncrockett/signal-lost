# Signal Lost Rewrite: Godot Engine Approach

## Overview

After evaluating the current state of the Signal Lost game, we've decided to completely rewrite it using the Godot Engine instead of a browser-based approach. This decision was made due to:

1. Performance issues with the browser-based implementation
2. Infinite render loop in the RadioTuner component
3. Difficulties with testing browser-based games
4. The need for a more suitable game development platform

This document outlines the plan for the rewrite, including tasks, timeline, and technical considerations.

## Previous Implementation Status

The previous browser-based implementation achieved:

- ✅ RadioTuner Component (basic functionality)
- ✅ Audio System (basic functionality)
- ✅ Message Decoder (basic functionality)
- ✅ Basic UI Components

However, we encountered significant challenges with performance, particularly with the RadioTuner component which suffered from an infinite render loop issue that made the game unplayable.

## Rewrite Goals

1. Create a fully testable game using Godot Engine
2. Maintain the core gameplay mechanics and narrative
3. Improve performance and stability
4. Establish a clean, maintainable architecture
5. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
6. Enable cross-platform deployment

## Technical Stack

- **Engine**: Godot 4.x
- **Language**: GDScript
- **State Management**: Godot's built-in signals and autoloaded singletons
- **UI**: Godot's Control nodes
- **Testing**: GUT (Godot Unit Testing)
- **Audio**: Godot's built-in audio system
- **Build**: Godot's export system
