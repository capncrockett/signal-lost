# Sprint: Godot Migration

> **Status**: Completed
> **Start Date**: April 2023
> **End Date**: May 2023

## Overview

This sprint focuses on migrating the Signal Lost game from a browser-based React application to the Godot Engine. The migration is necessary due to performance issues with the browser-based implementation, particularly with the radio tuner component which suffers from excessive rendering and infinite loop issues.

## Goals

- ✓ Create a migration plan for moving to Godot
- ✓ Set up the initial Godot project structure
- ✓ Clean up the repository by removing React-specific code
- ✓ Update documentation for Godot development
- ✓ Implement core game systems in Godot
- ✓ Implement the radio tuner component in Godot
- ✓ Set up testing infrastructure for Godot
- ✓ Migrate game assets to Godot
- ✓ Create a playable prototype in Godot

## Agent Alpha Responsibilities

### Primary Tasks

1. ✓ Create the initial Godot project structure
2. ✓ Implement the GameState singleton
3. ✓ Implement the AudioManager singleton
4. ✓ Create the RadioTuner scene and script
5. ✓ Set up unit testing with GUT (Godot Unit Testing)
6. ✓ Implement signal detection and processing
7. ✓ Create the main game scene
8. ✓ Implement audio visualization for the radio tuner

### Secondary Tasks

1. ✓ Update documentation for Godot development
2. ✓ Create example tests for the RadioTuner component
3. ✓ Optimize audio processing for better performance
4. ✓ Implement save/load functionality

## Agent Beta Responsibilities

### Primary Tasks

1. ✓ Clean up the repository by removing React-specific code
2. ✓ Set up CI/CD for Godot testing
3. ✓ Create manual test procedures for the Godot implementation
4. ✓ Implement the narrative system in Godot
5. ✓ Create the UI framework for the game
6. ✓ Implement the message display system
7. ☐ Set up the game world and locations

### Secondary Tasks

1. ✓ Update documentation for Godot development
2. ✓ Optimize resource usage
3. ☐ Implement accessibility features
4. ☐ Create a build pipeline for multiple platforms

## Technical Requirements

1. **Godot Version**: 4.x (stable)
2. **GDScript**: Use static typing where possible
3. **Testing**: Implement unit tests with GUT
4. **Architecture**: Follow Godot's node-based architecture
5. **Audio**: Use Godot's built-in audio processing capabilities
6. **UI**: Use Godot's Control nodes for UI elements
7. **State Management**: Use autoloaded singletons for global state

## Implementation Details

### Core Systems

1. **GameState Singleton**:
   - Manages game state, signals, and messages
   - Handles save/load functionality
   - Provides signal detection and processing

2. **AudioManager Singleton**:
   - Handles audio processing
   - Generates static noise and signal tones
   - Manages audio effects and mixing

3. **RadioTuner Scene**:
   - Implements the radio tuner interface
   - Handles frequency tuning and power state
   - Visualizes static and signal strength
   - Displays messages when signals are detected

4. **Narrative System**:
   - Manages the game's narrative progression
   - Handles message decoding and display
   - Tracks player progress and discoveries

### Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual scripts and components
   - Verify behavior of core systems
   - Ensure proper signal connections

2. **Manual Tests**:
   - Test gameplay mechanics
   - Verify audio and visual effects
   - Check performance on target platforms

## Definition of Done

- All primary tasks are completed
- Unit tests are passing with at least 80% coverage
- Manual tests are passing
- Documentation is up-to-date
- Code follows Godot style guide
- Performance is acceptable on target platforms
- Game is playable from start to finish
