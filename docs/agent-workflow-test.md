# Agent Workflow Test

This file is a simple test to verify that the cross-agent workflow is functioning correctly.

## Purpose

The purpose of this test is to:

1. Verify that Agent Alpha can create PRs that Agent Beta can see and review
2. Verify that the GitHub Actions workflow for cross-agent validation runs correctly
3. Ensure that both agents can collaborate effectively

## Expected Behavior

When this PR is created:

1. The cross-agent validation workflow should run automatically
2. Agent Beta should be able to see and review the PR
3. The workflow should generate feedback in the PR comments

## Next Steps

Once this test is successful, we can proceed with the actual development work using the Alpha/Beta agent workflow.
