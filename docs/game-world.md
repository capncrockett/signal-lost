# üåç Game World Development

## Overview

The game world in Signal Lost is where the player will explore and discover the mysteries behind the radio signals. This document outlines the design and implementation of the game world, player movement, and interaction systems.

## World Structure

The game world is divided into several key areas:

1. **Forest Area**: The starting location with dense trees and limited visibility
2. **Abandoned Buildings**: Old structures with hidden clues and items
3. **Radio Tower**: A central landmark that serves as a navigation point
4. **Underground Bunker**: A hidden area with important story elements
5. **Lake Area**: A serene location with unique audio characteristics
6. **Mountain Overlook**: Provides a vantage point to see the entire area

## Player Movement

The player will navigate the world using:

- First-person controller for immersive exploration
- Physics-based movement with proper collision detection
- Interaction with objects and environment
- Footstep sounds that change based on surface type
- Stamina system for running and climbing

## Interaction System

Players will interact with the world through:

- Contextual interaction prompts
- Pickup and examination of items
- Use of items in the environment
- Interaction with radio signals at specific locations
- Environmental puzzles

## Radio-World Connection

The core gameplay mechanic connects radio signals to physical locations:

- Certain frequencies are stronger in specific areas
- Finding the source of a signal requires exploration
- Physical landmarks provide clues about frequencies
- Signal strength increases as players approach the source
- Decoding messages may require visiting specific locations

## Inventory System

The player will collect and manage items:

- Limited inventory space requiring strategic choices
- Key items that are essential for progression
- Optional items that provide additional story context
- Tools that enable new interactions
- Radio components that can be upgraded

## Environmental Storytelling

The world tells its story through:

- Notes, journals, and recordings found in the environment
- Visual clues and arrangements of objects
- Environmental details that hint at past events
- Audio cues and ambient sounds
- Weather and time-of-day changes

## Technical Implementation

The game world will be implemented using:

- Godot's scene system for modular world design
- NavMesh for AI navigation
- Occlusion culling for performance optimization
- LOD (Level of Detail) system for distant objects
- Procedural generation for certain natural elements
- Dynamic lighting and weather systems

## Art Style

The visual style of the game world:

- Realistic but slightly stylized
- Emphasis on atmospheric lighting
- Detailed textures for close inspection
- Weather effects that affect visibility and mood
- Day/night cycle that changes the atmosphere

## Audio Design

The audio landscape of the game world:

- Ambient sounds that change based on location
- Dynamic audio mixing based on environment
- Spatial audio for immersive experience
- Weather sounds that affect the mood
- Radio static and signals that guide exploration

## Next Steps

1. Create a basic prototype of the forest area
2. Implement player controller with basic movement
3. Set up interaction system for objects
4. Connect radio functionality to specific locations
5. Implement inventory system
6. Add environmental storytelling elements
7. Create day/night cycle
8. Add weather effects
