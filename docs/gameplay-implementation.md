# Gameplay Implementation

## Overview

The gameplay implementation provides a cohesive game experience by integrating the various systems (radio, quests, inventory, map, etc.) into a unified gameplay loop. It manages the flow of the game from the main menu to gameplay to game over, and provides guidance to the player through a tutorial system.

## Key Components

### 1. GameplayManager

The GameplayManager is the central coordinator for the gameplay experience. It:

- Manages the overall game state and progression
- Coordinates between different game systems (radio, quests, inventory, map)
- Provides tutorial messages based on player actions
- Controls UI visibility based on game state
- Handles event signals from various systems

```csharp
public partial class GameplayManager : Node
{
    // References to game systems
    private GameState _gameState;
    private QuestSystem _questSystem;
    private RadioSignalsManager _radioSignalsManager;
    private InventorySystem _inventorySystem;
    private MapSystem _mapSystem;
    
    // Game state
    private bool _isGameInitialized = false;
    private bool _isRadioRepaired = false;
    private bool _isFirstSignalDiscovered = false;
    private bool _isFirstLocationVisited = false;
    
    // Methods for managing gameplay
    // ...
}
```

### 2. TutorialSystem

The TutorialSystem provides guidance to the player through contextual messages. It:

- Displays tutorial messages based on player actions
- Manages a queue of tutorial messages
- Tracks which tutorials have been shown
- Provides a UI for displaying tutorial messages

```csharp
public partial class TutorialSystem : Node
{
    // Tutorial state
    private Queue<string> _tutorialQueue = new Queue<string>();
    private bool _isTutorialActive = false;
    private double _tutorialTimer = 0.0;
    private double _tutorialDuration = 5.0; // Seconds to show tutorial message
    
    // Tutorial history
    private HashSet<string> _shownTutorials = new HashSet<string>();
    
    // Methods for managing tutorials
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Main Menu

The MainMenu provides the entry point to the game. It:

- Allows starting a new game
- Allows loading a saved game
- Provides access to options
- Allows quitting the game

```csharp
public partial class MainMenu : Control
{
    // UI elements
    private Button _newGameButton;
    private Button _loadGameButton;
    private Button _optionsButton;
    private Button _quitButton;
    
    // Methods for handling menu actions
    // ...
}
```

### 4. Game Over Screen

The GameOver screen provides closure to the game experience. It:

- Displays the ending based on player choices
- Allows returning to the main menu
- Allows quitting the game

```csharp
public partial class GameOver : Control
{
    // Ending data
    private string _endingType = "neutral";
    
    // Methods for handling game over
    // ...
}
```

### 5. Loading Screen

The LoadingScreen provides a transition between scenes. It:

- Displays a progress bar
- Shows random tips
- Loads the target scene after a delay

```csharp
public partial class LoadingScreen : Control
{
    // Loading state
    private string _targetScene = "";
    private double _loadingTime = 0.0;
    private double _loadingDuration = 2.0; // Seconds to show loading screen
    
    // Methods for handling loading
    // ...
}
```

### 6. Main Scene

The Main scene is the entry point for the game. It:

- Initializes game systems
- Loads the main menu

```csharp
public partial class Main : Node
{
    // Methods for initializing the game
    // ...
}
```

## Game Flow

The game flow follows this sequence:

1. **Main Scene**: Initializes game systems and loads the main menu
2. **Main Menu**: Allows starting a new game or loading a saved game
3. **Loading Screen**: Provides a transition to the gameplay
4. **Main Gameplay**: The core gameplay experience
5. **Game Over**: Provides closure to the game experience

## Gameplay Loop

The core gameplay loop consists of:

1. **Radio Repair**: The player starts with a damaged radio and must find parts to repair it
2. **Signal Discovery**: Once the radio is repaired, the player can discover signals
3. **Location Exploration**: The player explores different locations to find items and complete quests
4. **Quest Completion**: The player completes quests to progress through the game
5. **Game Progression**: As the player completes quests, the game progresses through different stages
6. **Ending**: The player reaches one of several possible endings based on their choices

## Integration with Game Systems

The gameplay implementation integrates with several other game systems:

### Radio System

- The player must repair the radio to progress
- Discovering signals provides clues and advances quests
- Different frequencies reveal different types of signals

### Quest System

- Quests provide goals and direction for the player
- Completing quests advances the game progression
- Some quests are only available after completing others

### Inventory System

- The player collects items to repair the radio and complete quests
- Some items are required to access certain locations
- Using items can trigger quest progression

### Map System

- The player discovers new locations as they progress
- Some locations are only accessible after completing certain quests
- Visiting locations can trigger quest progression

### Progression System

- The game progresses through different stages as the player completes quests
- Each stage has its own objectives and challenges
- The player's choices affect the ending they receive

## Tutorial System

The tutorial system provides guidance to the player through contextual messages:

- **Initial Guidance**: The player is guided to repair the radio
- **Radio Usage**: Once the radio is repaired, the player is taught how to use it
- **Signal Discovery**: The player is guided to discover signals
- **Location Exploration**: The player is guided to explore different locations
- **Quest Completion**: The player is guided to complete quests

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Quests**: Generate quests based on player actions and game state
2. **Branching Storylines**: Allow for multiple paths through the game
3. **Character Interactions**: Add NPCs with dialogue and relationships
4. **Environmental Storytelling**: Use the environment to tell the story
5. **Difficulty Settings**: Allow the player to adjust the difficulty
6. **Achievement System**: Add achievements for completing optional objectives
7. **Time System**: Add a day/night cycle and time-based events
8. **Weather System**: Add weather effects that impact gameplay
9. **Survival Mechanics**: Add hunger, thirst, and fatigue mechanics
10. **Crafting System**: Allow the player to craft items from collected resources
