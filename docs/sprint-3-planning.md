# Sprint 3 Planning

## Overview

Sprint 3 will focus on enhancing the radio tuner component and improving the overall user experience. We'll build on the solid foundation established in Sprint 2.5, where we successfully replaced external dependencies with native implementations and fixed all the failing tests.

## Goals

1. Improve the radio tuner component's visual feedback
2. Enhance the audio experience with better noise generation
3. Implement more interactive elements for the radio tuner
4. Add more signals and messages to discover
5. Improve the narrative flow and message display

## Tasks

### Radio Tuner Enhancements

- [ ] Add visual feedback for signal strength (Alpha)
- [ ] Implement a frequency display with digital-style numbers (Alpha)
- [ ] Add visual noise/static effect to the canvas when no signal is found (Alpha)
- [ ] Improve the slider component with better styling and interaction (Alpha)

### Audio Improvements

- [ ] Implement different noise types based on frequency (Alpha)
- [ ] Add volume control for the radio (Alpha)
- [ ] Implement audio filters for different signal qualities (Alpha)
- [ ] Add subtle background ambience (Alpha)

### Narrative Elements

- [ ] Add 5 new signals with corresponding messages (Beta)
- [ ] Implement a message history component (Beta)
- [ ] Add a decoding mechanic for encrypted messages (Beta)
- [ ] Implement a notebook feature for player notes (Beta)

### User Experience

- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for radio controls (Alpha)
- [ ] Implement a tutorial/help system (Beta)
- [ ] Add visual cues for discovered frequencies (Alpha)
- [ ] Improve the responsive design for different screen sizes (Beta)

### Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Update tests for new radio tuner features (Alpha)
- [ ] Add E2E tests for the new narrative elements (Beta)
- [ ] Update documentation with new features and components (Beta)
- [ ] Create user guide for the radio tuner (Beta)

## Timeline

- Week 1: Radio tuner visual enhancements and audio improvements
- Week 2: Narrative elements and user experience improvements
- Week 3: Testing, documentation, and final polish

## Success Criteria

- All tests passing with at least 80% coverage
- No TypeScript or linting errors
- Smooth and intuitive user experience
- Clear narrative progression through discovered signals
- Responsive design that works on different devices

## Cross-Agent Collaboration

As established in our workflow, Agent Alpha will focus on the radio tuner component and audio system, while Agent Beta will handle the narrative elements and user experience. We'll continue to use the PR review process for cross-agent collaboration and maintain our established workflow.
