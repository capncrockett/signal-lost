# Game Progression System

## Overview

The Game Progression System is a comprehensive framework for managing the player's progress through the game. It provides a structured approach to game progression with stages, milestones, and unlockable content.

## Key Features

1. **Stage-Based Progression**
   - The game is divided into distinct stages (Beginning, Exploration, Discovery, Revelation, Conclusion)
   - Each stage has its own description, objectives, and milestones
   - Progress is tracked within each stage (0-100%)

2. **Milestone System**
   - Each stage has specific milestones that contribute to progress
   - Completing milestones advances progress within the current stage
   - Milestones provide clear goals for the player

3. **Unlockable Content**
   - Content (locations, items, features) can be locked behind progression requirements
   - Unlocking content provides rewards for progression
   - Creates a sense of discovery and achievement

4. **Integration with Game Systems**
   - Connects with the radio system, inventory, map, and other game systems
   - Progress can be triggered by various in-game actions
   - Provides a cohesive gameplay experience

## System Architecture

The Game Progression System consists of several key components:

### 1. GameProgressionSystem

The core class that manages the game progression:

```csharp
public partial class GameProgressionSystem : Node
{
    // Game stages
    public enum GameStage
    {
        Beginning,
        Exploration,
        Discovery,
        Revelation,
        Conclusion
    }
    
    // Current game stage
    private GameStage _currentStage = GameStage.Beginning;
    
    // Progress within the current stage (0-100)
    private int _stageProgress = 0;
    
    // Stage descriptions, objectives, and milestones
    private Dictionary<GameStage, string> _stageDescriptions = new Dictionary<GameStage, string>();
    private Dictionary<GameStage, string> _stageObjectives = new Dictionary<GameStage, string>();
    private Dictionary<GameStage, List<StageMilestone>> _stageMilestones = new Dictionary<GameStage, List<StageMilestone>>();
    
    // Methods for managing progression, milestones, etc.
}
```

### 2. StageMilestone

A class that represents a milestone within a game stage:

```csharp
public class StageMilestone
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public int ProgressValue { get; set; }
    public bool IsCompleted { get; set; }
}
```

### 3. GameProgressionDisplay

A UI component that displays the game progression:

```csharp
public partial class GameProgressionDisplay : Control
{
    // UI elements
    [Export] private Label _stageLabel;
    [Export] private Label _objectiveLabel;
    [Export] private ProgressBar _progressBar;
    [Export] private ItemList _milestonesList;
    
    // Methods for updating the UI based on progression data
}
```

### 4. GameState Integration

The GameState class has been updated to support the game progression system:

```csharp
public partial class GameState : Node
{
    // Game progression properties
    public int GameProgress { get; set; } = 0;
    public int StageProgress { get; set; } = 0;
    
    // Dictionary to store completed milestones
    private HashSet<string> _completedMilestones = new HashSet<string>();
    
    // Methods for managing milestones
    public void SetMilestoneCompleted(string milestoneId);
    public bool IsMilestoneCompleted(string milestoneId);
    public HashSet<string> GetCompletedMilestones();
    public void ClearCompletedMilestones();
}
```

## Game Stages

The game is divided into five distinct stages:

1. **Beginning**
   - Description: "You've just arrived at the emergency bunker. Your radio is damaged and needs repair."
   - Objective: "Repair your radio by finding the necessary components."
   - Milestones:
     - Find radio parts (50% progress)
     - Repair radio (50% progress)

2. **Exploration**
   - Description: "With your radio working, you can now explore the surrounding area and look for other survivors."
   - Objective: "Explore the area and make contact with other survivors."
   - Milestones:
     - Discover emergency broadcast (20% progress)
     - Discover survivor signal (30% progress)
     - Visit old mill (50% progress)

3. **Discovery**
   - Description: "You've made contact with other survivors and discovered clues about what happened."
   - Objective: "Investigate the research facility and military outpost."
   - Milestones:
     - Find research keycard (25% progress)
     - Explore research facility (25% progress)
     - Find military badge (25% progress)
     - Explore military outpost (25% progress)

4. **Revelation**
   - Description: "The truth about the incident is starting to become clear as you piece together the evidence."
   - Objective: "Decode the mysterious signal and find the source."
   - Milestones:
     - Discover mysterious signal (25% progress)
     - Decode mysterious signal (25% progress)
     - Find tower key (25% progress)
     - Locate mysterious tower (25% progress)

5. **Conclusion**
   - Description: "You now know what happened and must make a final decision about what to do next."
   - Objective: "Reach the mysterious tower and confront the truth."
   - Milestones:
     - Enter mysterious tower (25% progress)
     - Discover truth (25% progress)
     - Make final decision (50% progress)

## Unlockable Content

The game progression system controls access to various content:

1. **Locations**
   - Research Facility: Unlocked in Exploration stage (50% progress)
   - Military Outpost: Unlocked in Discovery stage (25% progress)
   - Mysterious Tower: Unlocked in Revelation stage (75% progress)

2. **Items**

   - Strange Crystal: Unlocked in Revelation stage (25% progress)

3. **Features**
   - Additional radio frequencies
   - Enhanced signal detection
   - Hidden signal detection

## Integration with Game Systems

The Game Progression System integrates with several other game systems:

1. **Radio System**
   - Discovering signals can complete milestones
   - Certain signals are only available at specific progression stages
   - Radio capabilities improve as the player progresses

2. **Inventory System**
   - Key items are required to complete certain milestones
   - New items become available as the player progresses
   - Items can have different effects based on progression stage

3. **Map System**
   - New locations are unlocked as the player progresses
   - Visiting locations can complete milestones
   - Map reveals more details as the player progresses

## Usage Examples

### 1. Completing a Milestone

```csharp
// Get the game progression system
var progressionSystem = GetNode<GameProgressionSystem>("/root/GameProgressionSystem");

// Complete a milestone
progressionSystem.CompleteMilestone("find_radio_parts");
```

### 2. Checking if Content is Unlocked

```csharp
// Get the game progression system
var progressionSystem = GetNode<GameProgressionSystem>("/root/GameProgressionSystem");

// Check if content is unlocked
if (progressionSystem.IsContentUnlocked("research_facility"))
{
    // Allow access to the research facility
    AllowAccessToLocation("research_facility");
}
```

### 3. Advancing to the Next Stage

```csharp
// Get the game progression system
var progressionSystem = GetNode<GameProgressionSystem>("/root/GameProgressionSystem");

// Advance to the next stage
progressionSystem.AdvanceStage();
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Branching Progression**
   - Allow for multiple paths through the game
   - Different choices lead to different outcomes
