# Memory Leak Detection and Resolution

## Overview

Memory leaks can significantly impact game performance, especially in long-running applications like Signal Lost. This document outlines strategies for detecting and resolving memory leaks in the game, with a particular focus on the radio system components.

## Common Memory Leak Sources

1. **Unmanaged Resources**
   - Audio resources not properly disposed
   - Textures and images not released
   - File handles left open

2. **Event Handlers**
   - Event subscriptions not unsubscribed
   - Signal connections not disconnected
   - Callbacks not properly removed

3. **Circular References**
   - Objects referencing each other
   - Parent-child relationships not properly managed
   - Collections holding references to objects

## Detection Techniques

### Visual Monitoring

1. **Godot Debugger**
   - Monitor memory usage in the Godot debugger
   - Watch for steadily increasing memory usage
   - Check object counts for unexpected growth

2. **Performance Monitor**
   - Use OS performance tools (Task Manager, Activity Monitor)
   - Track memory usage over time
   - Look for memory that doesn't get released after scene changes

### Programmatic Detection

1. **Reference Counting**
   - Implement reference counting for critical resources
   - Log when objects are created and destroyed
   - Alert when objects aren't properly cleaned up

```csharp
public class ResourceTracker
{
    private static Dictionary<string, int> _resourceCounts = new Dictionary<string, int>();

    public static void TrackResource(string resourceType)
    {
        if (!_resourceCounts.ContainsKey(resourceType))
        {
            _resourceCounts[resourceType] = 0;
        }
        _resourceCounts[resourceType]++;
        GD.Print($"Resource created: {resourceType}, Count: {_resourceCounts[resourceType]}");
    }

    public static void UntrackResource(string resourceType)
    {
        if (_resourceCounts.ContainsKey(resourceType))
        {
            _resourceCounts[resourceType]--;
            GD.Print($"Resource released: {resourceType}, Count: {_resourceCounts[resourceType]}");
        }
    }

    public static void PrintResourceCounts()
    {
        GD.Print("Resource Counts:");
        foreach (var kvp in _resourceCounts)
        {
            GD.Print($"  {kvp.Key}: {kvp.Value}");
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Memory Snapshots**
   - Take memory snapshots at key points
   - Compare snapshots to identify leaks
   - Focus on specific object types

## Radio System Memory Management

The radio system is particularly susceptible to memory leaks due to its use of audio resources and signal processing. Here are specific areas to monitor:

### RadioAudioManager

1. **Audio Stream Players**
   - Ensure all AudioStreamPlayer instances are properly disposed
   - Stop and free streams when not in use
   - Use a resource pool for frequently used sounds

2. **Signal Processing**
   - Clean up signal processing resources
   - Dispose of FFT and other signal analysis objects
   - Release buffers when no longer needed

### RadioInterfaceManager

1. **Signal Connections**
   - Disconnect signals when the interface is hidden
   - Properly manage connections between components
   - Implement OnExit cleanup

2. **UI Resources**
   - Release UI textures and resources
   - Clean up any dynamically created UI elements
   - Ensure proper disposal of UI components

## Implementation Best Practices

### IDisposable Pattern

Implement the IDisposable pattern for classes that manage unmanaged resources:

```csharp
public class AudioResourceManager : Node, IDisposable
{
    private bool _disposed = false;
    private AudioStreamPlayer _player;
    
    public override void _Ready()
    {
        _player = new AudioStreamPlayer();
        AddChild(_player);
        ResourceTracker.TrackResource("AudioStreamPlayer");
    }
    
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
    
    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Dispose managed resources
                if (_player != null)
                {
                    _player.Stop();
                    _player.QueueFree();
                    ResourceTracker.UntrackResource("AudioStreamPlayer");
                }
            }
            
            // Free unmanaged resources
            
            _disposed = true;
        }
    }
    
    ~AudioResourceManager()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }
}
```

### Signal Management

Properly connect and disconnect signals:

```csharp
public override void _Ready()
{
    // Connect signals
    _radioInterface.FrequencyChanged += OnFrequencyChanged;
    _radioInterface.PowerToggle += OnPowerToggle;
}

public override void _ExitTree()
{
    // Disconnect signals
    if (_radioInterface != null)
    {
        _radioInterface.FrequencyChanged -= OnFrequencyChanged;
        _radioInterface.PowerToggle -= OnPowerToggle;
    }
}
```

### Resource Pooling

Use resource pooling for frequently used resources:

```csharp
public class AudioPool
{
    private Dictionary<string, Queue<AudioStreamPlayer>> _pool = new Dictionary<string, Queue<AudioStreamPlayer>>();
    private Node _parent;
    
    public AudioPool(Node parent)
    {
        _parent = parent;
    }
    
    public AudioStreamPlayer GetPlayer(string soundType)
    {
        if (!_pool.ContainsKey(soundType))
        {
            _pool[soundType] = new Queue<AudioStreamPlayer>();
        }
        
        if (_pool[soundType].Count > 0)
        {
            return _pool[soundType].Dequeue();
        }
        
        // Create new player
        var player = new AudioStreamPlayer();
        _parent.AddChild(player);
        ResourceTracker.TrackResource("AudioStreamPlayer");
        return player;
    }
    
    public void ReturnPlayer(string soundType, AudioStreamPlayer player)
    {
        if (!_pool.ContainsKey(soundType))
        {
            _pool[soundType] = new Queue<AudioStreamPlayer>();
        }
        
        player.Stop();
        _pool[soundType].Enqueue(player);
    }
    
    public void Clear()
    {
        foreach (var queue in _pool.Values)
        {
            while (queue.Count > 0)
            {
                var player = queue.Dequeue();
                player.QueueFree();
                ResourceTracker.UntrackResource("AudioStreamPlayer");
            }
        }
        
        _pool.Clear();
    }
}
```

## Testing for Memory Leaks

### Automated Tests

Create automated tests specifically for memory leak detection:

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void TestRadioSystemMemoryLeaks()
{
    // Setup
    var radioSystem = new RadioSystem();
    var initialMemory = GC.GetTotalMemory(true);
    
    // Act - simulate intensive usage
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        radioSystem.SetFrequency(90.0f + (i % 20));
        radioSystem.ProcessSignals();
    }
    
    // Cleanup
    radioSystem.Dispose();
    
    // Force garbage collection
    GC.Collect();
    GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
    GC.Collect();
    
    // Assert
    var finalMemory = GC.GetTotalMemory(true);
    var memoryDifference = finalMemory - initialMemory;
    
    // Allow for some overhead, but catch significant leaks
    Assert.IsTrue(memoryDifference < 1024 * 10, $"Memory leak detected: {memoryDifference} bytes");
}
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Long-Running Tests**
   - Run the game for extended periods
   - Monitor memory usage over time
   - Test specific features repeatedly

2. **Scene Switching**
   - Switch between scenes multiple times
   - Verify memory is properly released
   - Check for resource count discrepancies

## Conclusion

Memory leak detection and resolution is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and proper testing. By implementing the strategies outlined in this document, we can ensure that Signal Lost maintains optimal performance and stability, particularly for the memory-intensive radio system components.

Regular memory profiling and testing should be integrated into the development workflow to catch and fix leaks early before they impact the player experience.
