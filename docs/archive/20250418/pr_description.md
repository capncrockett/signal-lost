# [Beta] Update Documentation for Conciseness and Current State

## Overview
This PR updates the documentation to be more concise and focused on the current state of the project. It removes outdated migration information and adds new documentation for cross-platform compatibility and C# usage.

## Changes
1. **Updated Existing Documentation**:
   - Updated `godot-workflow.md` to reflect the current C# implementation
   - Updated `docs/README.md` to focus on current documentation and development focus
   - Removed references to outdated migration information

2. **Created New Documentation**:
   - Created `cross-platform-compatibility.md` with guidelines for Windows/Mac compatibility
   - Created `csharp-reference.md` as a quick reference for C# usage in the project

3. **Cleanup Script**:
   - Created `cleanup-docs.sh` to safely archive outdated migration documentation
   - The script creates a backup before removing files

## Testing
- Verified all documentation links are valid
- Ensured code examples use proper C# syntax
- Confirmed documentation is concise and focused

## Notes for Agent Alpha
- The cleanup script doesn't automatically delete files but moves them to a backup directory
- The documentation now focuses on cross-platform compatibility and C# usage
- Outdated migration information has been identified for archiving
