# Sprint: Game World Development

> **Status**: In Progress  
> **Start Date**: May 2023  
> **End Date**: TBD  

## Overview

This sprint focuses on developing the game world and exploration mechanics for Signal Lost. With the core radio tuner functionality and testing infrastructure in place, we can now focus on creating the game world, implementing player movement, and connecting the radio signals to physical locations in the game.

## Goals

- ☐ Create the game world with multiple locations
- ☐ Implement player movement and exploration
- ☐ Connect radio signals to physical locations
- ☐ Develop inventory system
- ☐ Implement game progression mechanics
- ☐ Create environmental storytelling elements
- ☐ Enhance audio-visual feedback

## Agent Alpha Responsibilities

1. ☐ Design and implement the game world structure
2. ☐ Create the player character controller
3. ☐ Implement camera system for exploration
4. ☐ Connect radio signals to physical locations
5. ☐ Create environmental storytelling elements
6. ☐ Implement day/night cycle
7. ☐ Add weather effects
8. ☐ Create ambient audio system

### Secondary Tasks

1. ☐ Optimize world loading and streaming
2. ☐ Implement save/load for world state
3. ☐ Create debug tools for world development
4. ☐ Add visual effects for environmental storytelling

## Agent Beta Responsibilities

### Primary Tasks

1. ☐ Implement inventory system
2. ☐ Create item interaction mechanics
3. ☐ Develop game progression tracking
4. ☐ Implement quest/objective system
5. ☐ Create UI for world exploration
6. ☐ Implement map system

2. ☐ Create tutorial system for new mechanics
3. ☐ Develop hint system for stuck players
4. ☐ Add quality-of-life features

## Technical Requirements

1. **World Structure**: Use Godot's scene system for modular world design
2. **Player Controller**: Implement smooth movement with proper collision detection
3. **Camera System**: Create a flexible camera system that works in different environments
4. **Inventory**: Design a flexible inventory system that can be extended
5. **Quest System**: Implement a data-driven quest system
6. **Environmental Effects**: Use Godot's particle and shader systems for visual effects
7. **Audio**: Create a layered ambient audio system

## Implementation Details

### Game World

1. **World Structure**:
   - Divide the world into interconnected scenes
   - Use a main world scene as a container
   - Implement scene transitions
   - Create a world state manager

2. **Player Character**:
   - First-person or third-person controller
   - Physics-based movement
   - Interaction with objects and environment
   - Footstep sounds and visual feedback

3. **Inventory System**:
   - Item data structure
   - UI for inventory management
   - Item use and combination mechanics
   - Item pickup and drop functionality

4. **Progression System**:
   - Track player progress
   - Unlock new areas based on discoveries
   - Connect radio signals to world locations
   - Create a sense of mystery and discovery

### Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test player controller functionality
   - Verify inventory operations
   - Test quest system logic
   - Validate world state management

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test player interaction with the environment
   - Verify radio-world connection
   - Test progression mechanics
   - Validate save/load functionality

3. **Manual Tests**:
   - Test gameplay flow
   - Verify environmental storytelling
   - Check performance in complex areas
   - Test audio-visual feedback

## Definition of Done

- All primary tasks are completed
- Unit tests are passing with at least 80% coverage
- Manual tests are passing
- Documentation is up-to-date
- Code follows Godot style guide
- Performance is acceptable on target platforms
- Game world is explorable and connected to the radio mechanics
