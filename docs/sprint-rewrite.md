## Progress Report

### Completed Tasks

- Set up React + TypeScript project with Vite
- Created basic component architecture
- Implemented basic layout and navigation
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Implemented state management with React Context
- Created design system and basic styling
- Built UI component library with form elements, modals, and loading indicators
- Implemented state persistence with localStorage

### In Progress

- Implementing radio tuner component

## Dependencies

This sprint is the first in the rewrite process and has no dependencies on previous sprints. However, it establishes the foundation for all future sprints.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Learning curve for new team members with React | Medium | Medium | Provide resources and pair programming sessions |
| Scope creep during architecture design | High | Medium | Clearly define MVP features and maintain focus |
| Performance issues with DOM-based approach | Medium | Low | Implement performance testing early |
| Testing infrastructure complexity | Medium | Medium | Start with simple tests and gradually add complexity |
| Asset migration challenges | Low | Medium | Create detailed inventory and migration plan |

## Definition of Done

- New React project is set up and running
- Component architecture is documented and implemented
- State management system is functional
- Basic layout and navigation work
- Testing infrastructure is in place
- Design system foundations are established
- Essential assets are migrated
- All implemented features have tests

## Next Sprint Preview

Sprint Rewrite 2 will focus on implementing the core game mechanics:
1. Radio tuner component
2. Audio system
3. Basic narrative system
