## Interface Contracts

To ensure smooth integration between the two agents' work, the following interfaces must be maintained:

### Signal Interface

```typescript
interface Signal {
  id: string;
  frequency: number;
  strength: number;
  type: 'message' | 'location' | 'event';
  content: string;
  discovered: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Event Interface

```typescript
interface GameEvent {
  id: string;
  type: 'signal' | 'narrative' | 'system';
  payload: unknown;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

## Dependencies

This sprint builds on Sprint 01's foundation:

- React component architecture
- Game state management
- Routing system
- Asset management
- Accessibility features

## Definition of Done

### Agent Alpha DoD

- Radio tuner component is fully functional
- Audio system generates appropriate sounds
- All audio components are integrated
- Unit and integration tests pass
- TypeScript types are complete
- Documentation is updated

### Agent Beta DoD

- Narrative system displays and decodes messages
- Game state management is complete
- Event system is functional
- Unit and integration tests pass
- TypeScript types are complete
- Documentation is updated

## Communication Protocol

Agents should:

1. Use GitHub Issues for task tracking
2. Create PRs with clear descriptions
3. Tag the other agent for interface-related changes
4. Update shared documentation
5. Use the established interfaces for integration points

## Git Workflow

### Branch Management

- Both agents work from the `develop` branch as the base
- Agent Alpha creates branches with prefix `feature/alpha/`
- Agent Beta creates branches with prefix `feature/beta/`
- Interface contract changes use prefix `feature/contract/`
- All PRs target the `develop` branch

### Commit Conventions

- Agent Alpha prefixes commits with `[Alpha]`
- Agent Beta prefixes commits with `[Beta]`
- Interface contract commits use `[Contract]` prefix
- Documentation updates use `[Docs]` prefix

### Git Configuration

- Agent Alpha uses default git configuration
- Agent Beta uses the following git configuration:
  - Username: `Capn Crockett`
  - Email: `crockettdevlabs@gmail.com`

## Next Sprint Preview

Sprint 03 will focus on implementing the field exploration and inventory systems:

1. Grid-based movement
2. Player character
3. Interactable objects
4. Inventory management
5. Item usage mechanics
