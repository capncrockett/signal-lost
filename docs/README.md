## Documentation Guidelines

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **Content Guidelines**:
=======
1. **Godot Documents**: Follow the naming convention `godot-feature.md`
2. **C# Documents**: Follow the naming convention `csharp-feature.md`
3. **Checkmarks**: Use ✅ for completed items and ⬜ for pending items
4. **Code Examples**: Include relevant C# code examples with proper syntax highlighting
5. **Screenshots**: Include screenshots where helpful, stored in the `assets` directory
6. **Links**: Use relative links to reference other documents or code files
>>>>>>> main

   - Keep documentation concise and focused
   - Include relevant C# code examples with proper syntax highlighting
   - Use checkmarks (✅/⬜) for tracking completion status
   - Use relative links to reference other documents

2. **Maintenance**:
   - Keep documentation up to date with current progress
   - Archive outdated documentation in the `archive` directory
   - Focus on pixel-based implementation details
   - Document cross-platform considerations

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Archived Documentation

Outdated documentation is archived in the `archive` directory, organized by date. This includes:

- Migration documentation
- Obsolete implementation details
- Historical sprint plans
=======
1. Keep the documentation up to date with current progress
2. Update the README.md with any new documentation files
3. Ensure all links remain valid
4. Maintain consistent formatting and style
