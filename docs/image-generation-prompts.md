Use a limited color palette with emphasis on grays, blacks, and accent lights. The style should be 16-bit pixel art with attention to detail, suitable for a mystery game called "Signal Lost". The dimensions should be exactly 64x64 pixels.
```

### Signal Detector (64x64px)

```
Generate a pixel art image of a handheld signal detector device with a display showing signal strength, multiple antennas, and blinking lights. The device should look somewhat cobbled together or modified, suggesting it's been customized for a specific purpose. Use a limited color palette with emphasis on technological elements and glowing indicators. The style should be 16-bit pixel art suitable for a mystery game called "Signal Lost". The dimensions should be exactly 64x64 pixels.
```

### Journal (64x64px)

```
Create a pixel art image of an open field journal with mysterious notes, diagrams of radio frequencies, and sketches of strange phenomena. The journal should appear weathered and well-used, with some pages dog-eared or marked. Use a limited color palette with emphasis on paper tones and ink colors. The style should be 16-bit pixel art with enough detail to suggest handwritten text without being readable. This will be used as an inventory item for a mystery game called "Signal Lost". The dimensions should be exactly 64x64 pixels.
```

### Strange Artifact (32x32px)

```
Generate a pixel art image of a small, mysterious artifact that appears to be of unknown origin. The artifact should have unusual geometric patterns, subtle glowing elements, and a design that suggests it might be related to communication or signal transmission. Use a limited color palette with emphasis on otherworldly elements and subtle lighting effects. The style should be 16-bit pixel art suitable for a mystery game called "Signal Lost". The dimensions should be exactly 32x32 pixels.
```

## UI Elements

### Game Title Screen (1280x720px)

```
Create a striking title screen image for a game called "Signal Lost". The design should feature the title in a distorted, glitchy font with radio/transmission imagery. Include elements like a distant radio tower, mysterious forest silhouettes, and signal/wave patterns. The atmosphere should be eerie and mysterious with a color palette dominated by dark blues, purples, and occasional red highlights. The style should be modern with a slight retro influence, suitable for a mystery game about strange radio signals and supernatural elements. The image should be 1280x720 pixels with space at the bottom for menu options.
```

### Menu Background (1280x720px)

```
Generate an atmospheric background image for a game menu. The image should show a subtle pattern resembling radio waves or signal interference overlaid on a dark, misty forest scene. Use a color palette of deep blues and purples with occasional glitchy elements in brighter colors. The design should be abstract enough to not distract from menu text while establishing the eerie, mysterious tone of a game called "Signal Lost". The style should be semi-realistic with digital distortion elements. The image should be 1280x720 pixels.
```

### Signal Strength Indicator (160x32px)

```
Create a pixel art image set of different signal strength indicators for a game UI. Design 5 variations showing increasing signal strength, from no signal (empty bars) to full signal (all bars filled). The indicators should have a vintage radio/technological aesthetic with glowing elements. Use a limited color palette with emphasis on UI readability against dark backgrounds. The style should be 16-bit pixel art suitable for a mystery game called "Signal Lost". Each indicator should be 32x16 pixels, arranged horizontally in a single 160x32 pixel image.
```

### Message Decoder Interface (128x64px)

```
Generate a pixel art image of a message decoder interface with a display screen showing partially decoded text, status lights, and control buttons. The interface should look like a specialized piece of equipment with a retro-technological aesthetic. Use a limited color palette with emphasis on screen elements and indicator lights.

```

## Atmospheric Elements

### Static Overlay (512x512px)

```
Create a seamless, tileable pattern resembling television or radio static. The pattern should be predominantly black and white with subtle variations in opacity to create a dynamic effect. The static should be fine-grained enough to be used as an overlay without completely obscuring what's beneath it. This will be used as a visual effect for a mystery game called "Signal Lost" to indicate signal interference. The style should be realistic static noise that can be tiled without visible seams. The image should be 512x512 pixels.
```

### Signal Wave Patterns (256x128px)

```
Generate a set of 4 different signal wave pattern images in pixel art style. Each pattern should represent different types of radio or electromagnetic waves (sine waves, square waves, complex interference patterns, etc.). Use a limited color palette with emphasis on glowing effects against dark backgrounds. The style should be 16-bit pixel art suitable for visual effects in a mystery game called "Signal Lost". Each pattern should be 64x32 pixels, arranged in a 2x2 grid to create a single 256x128 pixel image.
```

### Mysterious Symbols (192x192px)

```
Create a set of 6 mysterious symbol images in pixel art style. The symbols should appear to be part of an unknown language or code system, possibly related to communication or signal transmission. Each symbol should be distinct but share a common aesthetic, suggesting they belong to the same system. Use a limited color palette with emphasis on glowing or etched effects. The style should be 16-bit pixel art suitable for a mystery game called "Signal Lost". Each symbol should be 32x32 pixels, arranged in a 3x2 grid to create a single 192x192 pixel image.
```

### Weather Effects (800x600px each)

```
Generate a set of 3 different weather effect overlays: light rain, heavy fog, and strange atmospheric disturbance. Each overlay should be designed to be seamlessly tileable across a game screen. Use semi-transparent elements to ensure the effects don't completely obscure the game world. The style should be pixel art compatible with a 16-bit aesthetic but with modern transparency effects. These will be used as atmospheric elements for a mystery game called "Signal Lost". Each overlay should be 800x600 pixels to match the game's screen resolution.
