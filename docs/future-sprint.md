# Future Sprint: Refactoring and Performance Optimization

## Goals
This sprint will focus on refactoring duplicated code, optimizing performance, and addressing technical debt that wasn't addressed in the previous sprint.

## Code Refactoring

- [ ] Refactor duplicated code
  - [ ] Identify and consolidate duplicate logic across components
  - [ ] Create shared utilities for common operations
  - [ ] Standardize patterns for similar functionality

- [ ] Improve code organization
  - [ ] Reorganize file structure for better maintainability
  - [ ] Create proper module boundaries
  - [ ] Implement consistent naming conventions

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Optimize rendering performance
  - [ ] Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
  - [ ] Optimize sprite rendering
  - [ ] Reduce unnecessary redraws

- [ ] Optimize audio processing
  - [ ] Implement more efficient audio processing algorithms
  - [ ] Reduce audio memory usage
  - [ ] Optimize audio context management

- [ ] Optimize memory usage
  - [ ] Implement proper resource cleanup
  - [ ] Reduce memory leaks
  - [ ] Optimize asset loading and unloading

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Improve error handling
  - [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns
  - [ ] Add proper error recovery mechanisms
  - [ ] Improve error reporting

- [ ] Improve documentation
  - [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public methods
  - [ ] Create architecture documentation
  - [ ] Document design patterns and decisions

## Metrics and Monitoring

- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
  - [ ] Add FPS monitoring
  - [ ] Add memory usage monitoring
  - [ ] Add load time monitoring

- [ ] Implement analytics
  - [ ] Track user interactions
  - [ ] Track error rates
  - [ ] Track performance metrics

## Success Criteria

1. All duplicated code is refactored into shared utilities
2. Performance is improved by at least 20% (FPS, memory usage, load times)
3. All technical debt items are addressed
4. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
5. Monitoring and analytics are implemented and providing useful data
