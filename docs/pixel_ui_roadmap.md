## Resource Allocation

### Development Resources

- 1 UI Developer (primary)
- 1 Game Systems Developer (support)
- 1 Audio Engineer (consultation)

### Testing Resources

- Automated UI tests
- Manual gameplay testing
- User experience testing

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance issues with complex visualizations | Medium | Implement level-of-detail, optimize drawing routines |
| Inconsistent behavior across platforms | High | Extensive cross-platform testing, platform-specific optimizations |
| Audio-visual synchronization challenges | Medium | Implement robust timing system, fallback mechanisms |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Feature creep in UI design | High | Strict scope management, prioritize core features |
| Integration delays with other systems | Medium | Clear API definitions, regular integration testing |
| Technical debt from rapid prototyping | Medium | Code reviews, refactoring sprints |

## Success Criteria

The pixel-based UI system will be considered successful when:

1. All planned features are implemented and working correctly
2. The UI performs well on all target platforms
3. The radio interface is intuitive and enjoyable to use
4. The visual style is consistent with the game's aesthetic
5. The UI enhances rather than detracts from gameplay
