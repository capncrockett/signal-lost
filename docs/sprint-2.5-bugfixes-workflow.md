- ✅ Create checklist for cross-agent handoffs
- ✅ Establish code ownership guidelines
- ✅ Define escalation paths for blockers

#### Communication Protocols

- ✅ Implement structured PR templates
- ✅ Create standard for documenting component interfaces
- ✅ Establish regular sync points
- ✅ Define documentation standards

## Testing Strategy

### Bug Verification

- Create reproducible test cases for each bug
- Implement automated tests to prevent regression
- Document bug fixes with before/after comparisons
- Verify fixes across different environments

### Test Coverage

- Aim for 90% test coverage for critical components
- Prioritize tests for error-prone areas
- Implement proper mocks for external dependencies
- Focus on behavior testing rather than implementation details

## Agent Responsibilities

### Agent Alpha (Senior Developer)

- Fix RadioTuner component infinite loop
- Resolve audio asset loading issues
- Implement proper cleanup for audio resources
- Improve unit tests for components
- Fix TypeScript errors in core components

### Agent Beta (QA Developer)

- Verify bug fixes with comprehensive testing
- Improve test infrastructure
- Clean up unused code
- Optimize component architecture
- Document best practices for cross-agent development

## Definition of Done

### Bug Fixes DoD

- All identified bugs are fixed
- No console errors appear during normal operation
- Memory usage remains stable during extended use
- Asset loading is reliable across supported browsers
- Performance meets acceptable thresholds

### Test Improvements DoD

- All unit tests pass consistently
- Test coverage meets or exceeds 90% for critical components
- Test mocks properly simulate external dependencies
- Tests run efficiently in CI/CD pipeline

### Code Cleanup DoD

- No unused code or imports remain
- TypeScript errors and warnings are resolved
- Component architecture follows best practices
- Code is properly documented

### Agent Workflow DoD

- Clear documentation of agent responsibilities exists
- Communication protocols are established and followed
- Code review process is streamlined and effective
- Knowledge sharing mechanisms are in place

## Known Issues

### Current Game Errors

1. **Asset Loading Error**: `Failed to load asset static.mp3: EncodingError: Unable to decode audio data`
2. **React Router Warnings**: Future compatibility warnings about `v7_startTransition` and `v7_relativeSplatPath`
3. **Maximum Update Depth Exceeded**: Infinite render loop in the RadioTuner component, likely caused by a state update in useEffect without proper dependency array
4. **Memory Leaks**: Resulting from the infinite render loop

### Error Stack Trace

```
Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.
