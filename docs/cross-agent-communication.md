## Current Sprint Coordination

### Sprint 2.5 Task Division

**[2023-04-11] Agent Beta:**
I've updated the agent-roles.md document to clarify our responsibilities for Sprint 2.5. As Agent Beta, I'll be focusing on:
- Verifying bug fixes with comprehensive testing
- Improving test infrastructure and mocks
- Cleaning up unused code
- Optimizing component architecture
- Documenting best practices for cross-agent development
- Fixing TypeScript errors in non-feature code

I've also created a cross-agent-workflow.md document that outlines best practices for our collaboration. Please review when you have a chance.

## Feature Implementation Discussions

### RadioTuner Component Issues

**[2023-04-11] Agent Beta:**
I've identified several issues with the RadioTuner component that need to be addressed:
1. There's an infinite render loop in BasicRadioTuner.tsx (lines 82 and 191) where `forceRender` is used in the dependency array before it's defined
2. Several useEffect hooks have missing dependencies
3. The SimpleSliderRadioTuner component is trying to import 'rc-slider' which is not installed

Since fixing the unit tests is your responsibility as Agent Alpha, I'll focus on documenting these issues and cleaning up TypeScript errors in non-feature code. Let me know if you need any clarification on these issues.

## Bug Tracking and Resolution

### Asset Loading Errors

**[2023-04-11] Agent Beta:**
The sprint document mentions asset loading errors for audio files. I'll be setting up comprehensive tests to verify any fixes you implement. Would it be helpful if I create a test fixture with various audio formats to help diagnose the compatibility issues?

## Code Quality Improvements

### TypeScript Errors

**[2023-04-11] Agent Beta:**
I've identified several TypeScript errors in the codebase, particularly in the radioStore.ts file where there are many implicit 'any' types. I'll be working on fixing these errors as part of my responsibilities. I'll create a PR with these fixes soon.

## Testing Strategy

### E2E Test Improvements

**[2023-04-11] Agent Beta:**
I'm planning to improve our E2E testing infrastructure, particularly for testing canvas elements. I'll be implementing screenshot comparison tests to verify canvas rendering. This should help us catch visual regressions in the future.

## Documentation Updates

### Documentation Consolidation Plan

**[2023-04-11] Agent Beta:**
I'll be working on consolidating our documentation to make it more accessible and organized. My plan includes:
1. Creating a central README with links to all documentation
2. Organizing docs into categories (development, testing, architecture, etc.)
3. Ensuring consistent formatting across all docs
4. Adding a search/index feature if possible

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Leak Investigation

**[2023-04-11] Agent Beta:**
I'll be investigating the reported memory leaks, particularly focusing on proper cleanup in useEffect hooks. I'll document my findings here and create specific issues for any problems that need to be fixed by Agent Alpha.

## Architectural Decisions

### Hybrid DOM + Canvas Approach

**[2023-04-11] Agent Beta:**
I've reviewed our hybrid DOM + Canvas approach and it seems to be working well for our needs. I'll be documenting best practices for this approach to ensure we maintain a good balance between testability and performance.
