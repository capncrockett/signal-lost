# Sprint 2: Cleanup and Maintenance

## Goals
This sprint focuses on cleaning up the codebase, improving test infrastructure, and addressing technical debt to ensure a more maintainable and stable codebase moving forward.

## Revised Priorities

1. Fix critical TypeScript errors in core game files
2. Ensure all tests pass consistently
3. Clean up unused code and imports
4. Address remaining TypeScript errors in test files
5. Refactor duplicated code (if time permits)

## Code Cleanup

  - ✅ Add type declarations for external libraries
  - ✅ Create proper interfaces for signal data types
  - ✅ Create proper interfaces for event data types
  - ⬜ Fix remaining TypeScript errors in core files
  - ⬜ Fix TypeScript errors in test files

- ⬜ Refactor duplicated code (Moved to future sprint)
  - ⬜ Identify and consolidate duplicate logic across components
  - ⬜ Create shared utilities for common operations
  - ⬜ Standardize patterns for similar functionality

- ⬜ Remove unused code
  - ⬜ Delete dead code paths
  - ⬜ Remove commented-out code blocks
  - ✅ Clean up unused imports and variables
