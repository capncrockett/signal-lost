# Signal Lost: Sprint Planning

This document outlines the sprint structure and planning for the Signal Lost game development.

## Sprint Structure

Each sprint is designed to be approximately 1-2 weeks in duration, focusing on specific aspects of the game development. The sprints follow a logical progression, building on previous work while maintaining a clear focus on deliverable features.

## Naming Convention

Sprints follow a consistent naming convention:
- `sprint-XX-name.md` where XX is the two-digit sprint number and name is a brief descriptor
- Example: `sprint-01-foundation.md`, `sprint-02-core-mechanics.md`

## Sprint Archive

Completed sprints are moved to the `docs/archive` directory for reference, while current and upcoming sprints remain in the main `docs` directory.

## Sprint Overview

## Sprint Documentation Structure

Each sprint document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Goals**: High-level objectives for the sprint
2. **Current Sprint Priorities**: Specific tasks to be completed
3. **Feature Sections**: Detailed breakdown of each feature area
4. **Testing Strategy**: Approach to testing the sprint deliverables
5. **Dependencies**: Relationships to other sprints or components
6. **Risks and Mitigations**: Potential issues and how to address them
7. **Definition of Done**: Criteria for sprint completion
8. **Next Sprint Preview**: Overview of the upcoming sprint

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branches from `develop` for each major feature
2. Implement features with tests
3. Submit PRs for review
4. Merge to `develop` branch
5. At the end of each sprint, merge `develop` to `main` if stable

## Sprint Review Process

At the end of each sprint:
1. Review completed tasks against the Definition of Done
2. Document lessons learned
3. Update the sprint document with actual progress
4. Move completed sprint document to archive
5. Prepare the next sprint document
6. Create a PR to merge `develop` into `main`
