# Signal Lost: Sprint Planning

This document outlines the sprint structure and planning for the Signal Lost game development.

## Sprint Structure

Each sprint is designed to be approximately 1-2 weeks in duration, focusing on specific aspects of the game development. The sprints follow a logical progression, building on previous work while maintaining a clear focus on deliverable features.

## Naming Convention

Sprints follow a consistent naming convention:
- `sprint-XX-name.md` where XX is the two-digit sprint number and name is a brief descriptor
- Example: `sprint-01-foundation.md`, `sprint-02-core-mechanics.md`

## Sprint Archive

Completed sprints are moved to the `docs/archive` directory for reference, while current and upcoming sprints remain in the main `docs` directory.

## Sprint Overview

- Final bug fixes and polish

## Sprint Documentation Structure

Each sprint document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Goals**: High-level objectives for the sprint
2. **Current Sprint Priorities**: Specific tasks to be completed
3. **Feature Sections**: Detailed breakdown of each feature area
4. **Testing Strategy**: Approach to testing the sprint deliverables
5. **Dependencies**: Relationships to other sprints or components
6. **Risks and Mitigations**: Potential issues and how to address them
7. **Definition of Done**: Criteria for sprint completion
8. **Next Sprint Preview**: Overview of the upcoming sprint

## Development Workflow

1. Sync with develop branch
2. Create feature branches following agent prefixes:
   - Alpha agent: `feature/alpha/*`
   - Beta agent: `feature/beta/*`
   - Interface contracts: `feature/contract/*`
3. Implement features with tests
4. Validate against other agent's work
5. Submit PRs for review
6. Merge to `develop` branch after approval
7. At sprint end, merge `develop` to `main` if stable

## Cross-Agent Coordination

1. Daily sync with develop branch
2. Contract validation before PRs
3. Cross-agent review requirements
4. Interface contract management
5. Conflict resolution protocol

## Sprint Review Process

At the end of each sprint:
1. Review completed tasks against Definition of Done
2. Validate all agent interfaces
3. Document lessons learned
4. Update sprint document with actual progress
5. Move completed sprint document to archive
6. Prepare next sprint document
7. Create PR to merge `develop` into `main`
