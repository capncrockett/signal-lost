# Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup work performed to transition Signal Lost to a pixel-based UI implementation.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Cleanup

1. Removed outdated migration-related documentation:
   - `docs/godot-migration.md`
   - `docs/csharp-migration.md`
   - `docs/csharp-migration-tasks.md`
   - `docs/files-to-remove.md`
   - `docs/godot-cleanup-plan.md`
   - `docs/sprint-godot-migration.md`

2. Added new pixel-based UI documentation:
   - `docs/pixel-ui-system.md`
   - `docs/README-pixel-ui.md`

### Code Cleanup

1. Verified removal of all GDScript files (except in addons)
2. Updated scene files to use pixel-based implementations:
   - Updated references from old UI classes to new pixel-based classes
   - Fixed path case sensitivity issues for cross-platform compatibility

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

1. Fixed path case sensitivity issues in scene files
2. Updated TestRunner.cs for cross-platform compatibility
3. Updated test running scripts for both Windows and macOS:
   - `godot_project/run_tests.sh`
   - `godot_project/run_tests.bat`

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run the tests on both Windows and macOS to ensure everything works correctly
2. **Documentation**: Continue updating documentation to reflect the pixel-based approach
3. **Development**: Focus on enhancing the pixel-based UI components
4. **Memory Leaks**: Address any memory leaks in the pixel-based implementation

## Conclusion

The codebase has been successfully cleaned up and is now focused on the pixel-based UI implementation. The transition from the old browser-based implementation to the new Godot-based implementation with pixel UI is complete.
