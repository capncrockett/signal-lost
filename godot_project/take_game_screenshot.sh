# AI Agent Screenshot Tool
# 
# This script runs the game scene screenshot tool, which:
# 1. Loads the main game scene (PixelMainScene.tscn)
# 2. Waits 5 seconds for the scene to fully render
# 3. Takes a screenshot and saves it to the user data directory
# 4. Automatically exits after taking the screenshot
#
# The screenshots are saved to:
# ~/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/Signal Lost/Screenshots/
# with timestamped filenames like: game_screenshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png

# [REMOVED: Screenshot shell script no longer needed for E2E]
