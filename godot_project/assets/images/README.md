# Image Assets

This directory contains image assets for the Signal Lost project.

You'll need to add your own image files here, such as:
- icon.png (used as the project icon)
- radio_background.png
- static_texture.png
- signal_indicator.png

For testing purposes, you can use any image files you have available, or generate simple ones using a tool like GIMP or Photoshop.
