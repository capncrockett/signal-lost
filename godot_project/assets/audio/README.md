# Audio Assets

This directory contains audio assets for the Signal Lost project.

You'll need to add your own audio files here, such as:
- static.wav
- signal.wav
- click.wav
- tune.wav

For testing purposes, you can use any audio files you have available, or generate simple ones using a tool like Audacity.
