1. `docs/memory-leak-detection.md` - Memory leak detection is now covered in the testing documentation
2. `docs/radio-dial-fix-plan.md` - Radio dial fixes have been implemented and are now part of the main documentation
3. `docs/component_integration.md` - Component integration is now covered in the codebase documentation
4. `docs/audio-system-implementation-plan.md` - Superseded by the comprehensive `audio-system.md`

6. `docs/user_documentation.md` - Consolidated into `user-guide.md`

### Documentation Index Updated

The `docs/README.md` file has been updated to:

1. Remove references to archived files
2. Add references to newer documentation files
3. Update the current development focus to reflect recent progress
4. Maintain a clean and organized structure

### Cleanup Script Enhanced

The `cleanup-docs.sh` script has been enhanced to:

1. Archive redundant or outdated documentation files
2. Create a dated archive directory
3. Check for and optionally clean up old archive folders
4. Provide guidance on updating the documentation index

## Next Steps

1. Continue to maintain documentation as the project evolves
2. Consider further consolidation of similar documentation topics
3. Ensure all new features are properly documented
4. Keep the documentation index up to date

## Conclusion

This cleanup has streamlined the documentation, making it easier to navigate and maintain. The project now has a more focused set of documentation files that better reflect the current state of development.
